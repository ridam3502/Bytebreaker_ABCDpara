1.INTRODUCTION

The ABCD parameters, also known as transmission line parameters, describe the relationship between the sending-end and receiving-end voltages and currents of a two-port network such as a transmission line.

The general form is:
Vs=AVr+BIr
Is= CVr+DIr
where

Vs , Is :- sending  end  voltage  and  current

Vr , Ir :- receiving  end  voltage  and  current

A , B , C , D :- transmission  line  constants

2.TYPES OF ABCD TRANSMISSION LINE:-

a) Short Transmission Line (Length < 80 km)
Assuming lumped parameters:

Series impedance: 
𝑍=1. Short Transmission Line (Length < 80 km)
Assuming lumped parameters:

Series impedance: 

𝑍=𝑅+𝑗𝑋

𝐴=D=1

𝐵=𝑍

𝐶=0

b) Medium Transmission Line (80–250 km)
Using the nominal π model:

Series impedance: 
𝑍=𝑅+𝑗𝑋

Shunt admittance: 

Y=jωC

𝐴=𝐷=1+𝑌𝑍/2
𝐵=Z
𝐶=𝑌(1+𝑌𝑍/4)

c) Long Transmission Line (> 250 km)
Distributed parameters:

Propagation constant: 

𝛾= square root of (ZY)

Characteristic impedance: 

𝑍𝑐=square root of (Z/Y)

A=D=cosh(γl),B=ZcSinh(γl),C=(1/Zc)sinh(γl)

Where 
l is the length of the line.

3.IMPORTANT PROPERTIES :-

AD−BC=1 (for reciprocal networks like transmission lines)

The parameters are complex and frequency-dependent.
