1.INTRODUCTION

The ABCD parameters, also known as transmission line parameters, describe the relationship between the sending-end and receiving-end voltages and currents of a two-port network such as a transmission line.

The matrix form is 
[Vs]   =   [A  B]   [Vr]


                    [Is]  =    [C  D]    [Ir]

AND 

The general form is:

Vs=AVr+BIr

Is= CVr+DIr
where

Vs , Is :- sending  end  voltage  and  current

Vr , Ir :- receiving  end  voltage  and  current

A , B , C , D :- transmission  line  constants

2. PHYSICAL MEANING OF ABCD PARAMETERS :-
   
*A: Ratio of sending-end voltage to receiving-end voltage when receiving-end current is zero (open-circuit).

*B: Ratio of sending-end voltage to receiving-end current when receiving-end voltage is zero (short-circuit).

*C: Ratio of sending-end current to receiving-end voltage when receiving-end current is zero.

*D: Ratio of sending-end current to receiving-end current when receiving-end voltage is zero.


 3.TYPES OF ABCD TRANSMISSION LINE:-
 
 The values of A, B, C, and D depend on the electrical characteristics of the line (resistance, inductance, capacitance, conductance) and the length of the line. Based on the length, transmission lines are classified into short, medium, and long lines, each having different models and corresponding ABCD parameters:

a) Short Transmission Line (Length < 80 km) :- Short lines neglect shunt capacitance and are modeled with only series impedance.
Assuming lumped parameters:

Series impedance: 
𝑍=1. Short Transmission Line (Length < 80 km)
Assuming lumped parameters:

Series impedance: 

𝑍=𝑅+𝑗𝑋

𝐴=D=1

𝐵=𝑍

𝐶=0

b) Medium Transmission Line (80–250 km) :- Medium lines include both series impedance and shunt admittance, typically using a nominal π or T model.
Using the nominal π model:

Series impedance: 
𝑍=𝑅+𝑗𝑋

Shunt admittance: 

Y=jωC

𝐴=𝐷=1+(𝑌𝑍/2)

𝐵=Z

𝐶=𝑌*(1+𝑌𝑍/4)

c) Long Transmission Line (> 250 km) :- Long lines consider the distributed nature of line parameters using hyperbolic functions.

Distributed parameters:

Propagation constant: 

γ = √(ZY) 

Characteristic impedance:

Zc = √(Z/Y) 

A=D=cosh(γl),B=Zc*Sinh(γl),C=(1/Zc)*sinh(γl)

Where 
l is the length of the line.

4. IMPORTANT PROPERTIES :-

*AD−BC=1 (for reciprocal networks like transmission lines)

*The parameters are complex and frequency-dependent.
​
*They are used to analyze voltage regulation, transmission efficiency, and performance of power systems.

5. CONCLUSION  :-

The ABCD parameters provide a systematic and efficient way to analyze transmission lines by expressing the sending-end voltage and current in terms of the 
receiving-end values and it also  provide a compact way to model the voltage and current relationships in transmission lines of different lengths. . 
These parameters simplify the study of power flow, voltage regulation, and stability in power systems. Depending on the line length, 
appropriate models (short, medium, or long) are used to derive the ABCD constants.
