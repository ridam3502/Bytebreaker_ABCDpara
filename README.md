### About the Experiment 

The ABCD parameters (also known as transmission line parameters) are a set of four constants used to describe the voltage and current relationships at the input and output terminals of a two-port network, such as a transmission line. These parameters are particularly useful in electrical engineering for analyzing and designing communication and power systems.
